Bank Customer Segmentation

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits. In this project, I have performed a customer segmentation on a dataset containing customer demographics and transactions data from an Indian Bank.




About the Dataset

This dataset consists of 1 Million+ transactions by over 800K customers for a bank in India. The data includes information such as customer age, gender, location, account balance, transaction details, transaction amount etc.


Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation and identify customer groups along with their definitions/rules. By gaining a deeper understanding of our customers, the bank can better tailor its services to meet customer need and preferences.


Intresting Analysis Ideas

* Perform CLustering / Segmenatation on the dataset and identify popular customer groups.
* Perform Location wise analysis to identify regional trends for improving user experiences.
* Perform transaction-related analysis to identify intresting trends for improving user experiences.
* Conduct customer RFM analysis.
* Explore Network analysis or graph analysis of customer data.
